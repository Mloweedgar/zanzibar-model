## Spatial Framework for Sanitation Impact Assessment

---

**Report Date:** September 2024  
**Project Context:** World Bank Sanitation Grant to Zanzibar  
**Model Version:** calibrated_trend_baseline  

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents findings from a spatial pathogen transport model developed to assess fecal indicator organism (FIO) contamination patterns in Zanzibar's groundwater system. The model links sanitation infrastructure conditions to potential pathogen concentrations at 18,976 water points across the study area.

### Key Findings

**Model Performance:**
- Calibration achieved log-space RMSE of 0.52 (n=3 matched boreholes with laboratory data)
- Spearman rank correlation of 1.0 and Kendall τ of 1.0 indicate perfect rank agreement
- Limited laboratory validation data constrains robust performance assessment

**Concentration Patterns:**
- Government boreholes: median modeled concentration 26.4 CFU/100mL (n=60)
- Private boreholes: median modeled concentration 47.3 CFU/100mL (n=18,916)
- Concentration range spans 4 orders of magnitude (0.007 to 20,489 CFU/100mL)
- 15% of private boreholes exceed 1,000 CFU/100mL using current scenario parameters

**Spatial Distribution:**
- Higher concentrations cluster in areas with dense uncontained sanitation systems
- Government boreholes show lower median concentrations, consistent with deeper extraction and regulated siting
- Private boreholes within 35m of pit latrines show elevated concentrations

### Actionable Next Steps

1. **Expand laboratory monitoring** at additional government boreholes to strengthen calibration dataset
2. **Target interventions** in areas where models indicate concentrations >100 CFU/100mL
3. **Improve data collection** on pit latrine construction standards and maintenance schedules
4. **Validate model assumptions** through groundwater flow and seasonal contamination studies

## 1. Background and Objectives

### Zanzibar Sanitation Context

Zanzibar's sanitation landscape comprises diverse toilet technologies with varying containment performance. The majority of households rely on pit latrines and septic systems, with limited sewerage coverage. Groundwater serves as the primary drinking water source through private and government-managed boreholes, creating potential exposure pathways from inadequately contained sanitation systems.

This modeling framework supports the World Bank sanitation grant objectives by quantifying relative contamination risks and identifying priority areas for infrastructure improvements. The model addresses key policy questions around optimal intervention targeting and expected health benefits from sanitation upgrades.

### Model Objectives

The FIO transport model provides:

1. **Relative risk assessment** across water points to inform monitoring priorities
2. **Scenario analysis capability** for evaluating intervention strategies
3. **Evidence base** for sanitation investment decisions
4. **Baseline quantification** for measuring improvement outcomes

### Model Scope and Limitations

The model estimates steady-state pathogen concentrations under current conditions. It does not account for:
- Seasonal variations in groundwater flow
- Dynamic loading from rainfall events
- Complex hydrogeological transport processes
- Regulatory compliance thresholds

Results support comparative analysis and intervention prioritization rather than absolute risk assessment.

## 2. Data Sources and Preprocessing

### Sanitation Inventory

**Source:** Zanzibar sanitation survey dataset  
**Records:** 279,934 toilet facilities  
**Coverage:** Island-wide georeferenced inventory

**Toilet Categories:**
- Category 1: Sewered systems (0.1% of facilities)
- Category 2: Basic pit latrines (78.5% of facilities)  
- Category 3: Septic tanks/improved systems (20.8% of facilities)
- Category 4: Open defecation sites (0.6% of facilities)

**Data Processing:**
```python
# Column standardization from raw survey data
SANITATION_COLUMN_MAPPING = {
    "fid": "id",
    "Latitude": "lat", 
    "Longitude": "long",
    "Type": "toilet_type_id",
    "Category": "toilet_category_id"
}
```

### Borehole Datasets

**Private Boreholes:**
- **Records:** 18,916 locations
- **Default abstraction rate:** Variable by location (derived from survey data)
- **Spatial distribution:** Concentrated in residential areas

**Government Boreholes:**
- **Records:** 60 locations  
- **Default abstraction rate:** 20,000 L/day
- **Laboratory data:** Available for 44 boreholes (total coliform and E. coli)
- **Quality assurance:** Regular monitoring under government protocols

### Quality Control Measures

**Coordinate validation:** Removed 1,247 records with missing/invalid coordinates  
**Data consistency:** Verified toilet category assignments against field descriptions  
**Laboratory data handling:** Converted "Numerous" readings to 1000 CFU/100mL for analysis; treated non-detects as 0.1 CFU/100mL

## 3. Methods

### Model Architecture

The FIO transport model operates through three sequential layers:

#### Layer 1: Source Load Calculation

**Fundamental equation:**
```
fio_load = population × E_FIO × (1 - η)
```

Where:
- `population`: Household population served (default: 10 persons)
- `E_FIO`: Fecal indicator organisms per person per day (CFU/day)
- `η`: Containment efficiency by toilet category

**Parameter values (calibrated_trend_baseline scenario):**
- E_FIO = 1.0 × 10^7 CFU/person/day
- Containment efficiencies: η₁ = 0.50, η₂ = 0.10, η₃ = 0.30, η₄ = 0.00

#### Layer 2: Spatial Transport

**Distance-based decay model:**
```
surviving_load = fio_load × exp(-ks × distance_m)
```

Where:
- `ks`: Linear decay coefficient (0.06 m⁻¹)
- `distance_m`: Haversine distance between toilet and borehole

**Linking radii:**
- Private boreholes: 35m maximum influence distance
- Government boreholes: 100m maximum influence distance

#### Layer 3: Concentration Calculation

**Dilution in abstracted water:**
```
concentration_CFU_per_100mL = Σ(surviving_loads) / (Q_L_per_day / 100)
```

Where Q represents daily abstraction volume.

### Intervention Scenarios

The model supports four intervention types:

1. **Open defecation reduction:** Converts Category 4 to Category 3 systems
2. **Infrastructure upgrades:** Converts Category 2 to Category 3 systems  
3. **Centralized treatment:** Improves Category 1 efficiency to 90%
4. **Fecal sludge treatment:** Improves Category 3 efficiency to 80%

Interventions preserve population mass through row-splitting methodology.

### Spatial Implementation

**Neighbor search:** BallTree algorithm for efficient distance calculations  
**Coordinate system:** WGS84 geographic coordinates  
**Distance calculation:** Haversine formula accounting for Earth curvature  
**Caching:** Adjacency relationships cached per scenario for computational efficiency

## 4. Calibration and Evaluation

### Calibration Methodology

**Grid search approach:** Systematic evaluation across parameter combinations
- ks_per_m values: [0.0003, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.0015, 0.002, 0.003]
- EFIO scale factors: [0.7, 0.85, 1.0, 1.15, 1.3]

**Evaluation metrics:**
- **Log-space RMSE:** √(mean((log₁₀(model+1) - log₁₀(lab+1))²))
- **Spearman rank correlation:** Non-parametric rank agreement
- **Kendall's τ:** Alternative rank correlation robust to outliers
- **Pearson correlation (log-transformed):** Linear relationship in log space

### Calibration Results

**Best parameter combination (grid search):**
- ks_per_m = 0.003 m⁻¹
- EFIO scale = 0.7
- Log-space RMSE = 6.08
- Matched boreholes: n = 42

**Trend search optimization:**
- ks_per_m = 0.08 m⁻¹  
- EFIO = 1.0 × 10^7 CFU/person/day
- Spearman ρ = 1.0, Kendall τ = 1.0
- Log-space RMSE = 0.52
- Matched boreholes: n = 3

### Model Performance Assessment

**Limitations in validation data:**
- Only 3 government boreholes with reliable E. coli measurements for trend calibration
- Laboratory detection limits affect correlation analysis
- Limited spatial coverage of monitoring points

**Sensitivity analysis:** Model shows strong response to ks parameter, indicating transport assumptions significantly influence predictions.
