# Zanzibar FIO Pathogen Modeling
## Executive Presentation: Spatial Sanitation Risk Assessment

---

### Slide 1: Purpose and Context

**Title:** Zanzibar Groundwater Contamination Risk Model  
**Project:** World Bank Sanitation Grant Support  
**Date:** September 2024  

**Objective:** Quantify relative contamination risks at 18,976 water points to inform sanitation investment priorities

**Key Question:** Where should we target interventions to achieve maximum health benefits?

### Slide 2: Model Overview - Three-Layer Framework

**Layer 1: Source Loading**
- 279,934 toilet facilities mapped island-wide
- Load = Population √ó Pathogen shedding √ó (1 - Containment efficiency)
- Categories: Sewered (0.1%), Pit latrines (78.5%), Septic (20.8%), Open defecation (0.6%)

**Layer 2: Spatial Transport**  
- Distance-based decay: Load √ó exp(-0.06 √ó distance)
- Private boreholes: 35m influence radius
- Government boreholes: 100m influence radius

**Layer 3: Water Dilution**
- Concentration = Total pathogen load √∑ Abstraction volume
- Results in CFU/100mL at each water point

---

### Slide 3: Data Foundation

**Inputs:**
- Sanitation survey: 279,934 toilet facilities with GPS coordinates
- Water points: 18,916 private + 60 government boreholes  
- Laboratory data: 44 government boreholes with E. coli measurements
- Abstraction rates: 20,000 L/day (government), variable (private)

**Data Quality:**
- Island-wide spatial coverage achieved
- Limited laboratory validation data (88.6% non-detects)
- Coordinates validated, missing data removed

**Key Limitation:** Model calibration constrained by sparse laboratory dataset

---

### Slide 4: How We Link Toilets to Boreholes

**Spatial Approach:**
- Haversine distance calculation (accounts for Earth curvature)
- Exponential decay with distance (ks = 0.06 m‚Åª¬π)
- Different influence radii by borehole type reflect pumping capacity

**Transport Assumptions:**
- Uniform subsurface properties (simplified)  
- No groundwater flow direction
- Steady-state conditions

**Computational Efficiency:**
- 89,451 private links + 788 government links cached
- BallTree algorithm for fast neighbor search

### Slide 5: Scenario Parameters (calibrated_trend_baseline)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Pathogen shedding** | 10‚Å∑ CFU/person/day | Literature-based estimate |
| **Decay coefficient** | 0.06 m‚Åª¬π | Calibrated to trend data |
| **Containment efficiency** | | |
| - Sewered systems | 50% | Moderate WWTP performance |
| - Basic pit latrines | 10% | Limited containment |  
| - Septic tanks | 30% | Variable construction quality |
| - Open defecation | 0% | No containment |
| **Household population** | 10 persons | Regional average |

**Calibration Status:** Limited validation data (n=3 matched points)

---

### Slide 6: Modeled Concentration Patterns

**Private Boreholes (n=18,916):**
- Low risk (<10 CFU/100mL): 36.2%
- Moderate risk (10-99 CFU/100mL): 33.0%
- High risk (100-999 CFU/100mL): 15.9%
- Very high risk (‚â•1000 CFU/100mL): 15.0%

**Government Boreholes (n=60):**  
- Low risk (<10 CFU/100mL): 30.0%
- Moderate risk (10-99 CFU/100mL): 46.7%
- High risk (100-999 CFU/100mL): 20.0%
- Very high risk (‚â•1000 CFU/100mL): 3.3%

**Map Legend:** 
- üìç Private boreholes (blue pins, 35m radius)
- üèõÔ∏è Government boreholes (red pins, 100m radius)  
- Color intensity indicates concentration category

### Slide 7: Model vs Laboratory Data

**Available Validation:**
- 44 government boreholes with E. coli measurements
- 39 non-detects (88.6%), 5 positive detections (11.4%)
- Analysis limited to 3 boreholes with measurable E. coli

**Performance Metrics (n=3):**
- **Spearman rank correlation:** 1.0 (perfect rank agreement)
- **Kendall's œÑ:** 1.0 (confirms rank consistency)
- **Log-space RMSE:** 0.52 (reasonable prediction accuracy)
- **Pearson r (log-transformed):** 0.74 (good linear relationship)

**Interpretation:** Model correctly ranks relative risks but requires expanded validation dataset

---

### Slide 8: Private vs Government Distribution Comparison

**Median Concentrations:**
- Private boreholes: 47.3 CFU/100mL  
- Government boreholes: 26.4 CFU/100mL

**Distribution Characteristics:**
- Government boreholes show lower median (better regulated siting/construction)
- Both distributions span 4 orders of magnitude
- Private boreholes have higher proportion in very high risk category (15.0% vs 3.3%)

**Geographic Patterns:**
- Higher concentrations in dense residential areas
- Lower concentrations in regulated government well fields
- Clustering around uncontained sanitation systems

---

### Slide 9: Key Findings - Evidence-Based Patterns

**Concentration Ranges:**
- 99% of boreholes: 0.007 to 20,489 CFU/100mL  
- 4 orders of magnitude variation reflects diverse local conditions
- 2,831 private boreholes (15.0%) exceed 1,000 CFU/100mL

**Spatial Distribution:**
- Dense pit latrine areas show elevated concentrations
- Government boreholes generally better positioned relative to contamination sources
- Distance decay evident within 35-100m influence radii

**System Performance:**
- Current containment efficiencies: 10-50% depending on toilet type
- 78.5% of population relies on basic pit latrines (10% efficiency)
- Limited sewerage coverage constrains high-efficiency options

**Model Reliability:** Results consistent with expected patterns but require validation data expansion

---

### Slide 10: Sensitivities and Limitations

**Key Uncertainties:**
- **Laboratory data:** Only 3 boreholes with reliable E. coli measurements for calibration
- **Hydrogeology:** Uniform transport assumptions ignore subsurface heterogeneity  
- **Seasonality:** Dry season model may not capture wet season dynamics
- **Maintenance:** Pit latrine emptying schedules not incorporated

**Parameter Sensitivity:**
- Decay coefficient impacts concentration predictions by 2-3 orders of magnitude
- Pathogen shedding estimates vary significantly across literature
- Containment efficiency assumptions critical for relative rankings

**Model Intent:** 
- Designed for **relative risk comparison** and **intervention prioritization**
- **Not suitable** for regulatory compliance assessment or absolute health risk calculation

---

### Slide 11: Suggested Next Steps

**Immediate (0-6 months):**
1. **Expand monitoring:** Add 15-20 government boreholes to monthly E. coli sampling program
2. **Target interventions:** Priority upgrades where model indicates >100 CFU/100mL
3. **Quality assurance:** Standardize laboratory detection limits and protocols

**Short-term (6-18 months):**
4. **Enhanced data:** Survey pit latrine construction standards in high-risk areas  
5. **Seasonal validation:** Conduct wet and dry season sampling campaigns
6. **Intervention tracking:** Monitor concentration changes following upgrades

**Long-term (18+ months):**
7. **Model refinement:** Incorporate groundwater flow and seasonal variations
8. **Policy integration:** Establish model-based criteria for borehole siting approvals
9. **Health risk assessment:** Link concentrations to quantitative risk frameworks

**Investment Focus:** Prioritize pit latrine upgrades in areas with multiple high-risk water points
