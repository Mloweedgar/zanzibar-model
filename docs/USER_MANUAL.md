# BEST-Z Dashboard User Manual

## üìñ Overview

The BEST-Z Dashboard is an interactive tool for exploring nitrogen and pathogen contamination scenarios in Zanzibar. The dashboard uses default Zanzibar data to help decision makers understand public health risks and plan sanitation interventions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for initial setup)

### Opening the Dashboard
1. Navigate to the dashboard URL (provided by your administrator)
2. The dashboard will automatically load with default Zanzibar data
3. Start exploring scenarios using the sidebar controls

## üéØ Main Features

### 1. **Pathogen Analysis Tab** ü¶†
Focus on disease contamination and public health risks:
- Interactive contamination maps showing disease hot-spots
- Real-time intervention impact modeling
- Priority ward identification for urgent action

### 2. **Nitrogen Analysis Tab** üß™  
Technical nitrogen load modeling:
- Ward-level nitrogen load visualization
- Scenario parameter adjustment
- Data export capabilities

## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Main Outputs

#### 1. Interactive Map
- **Red areas**: High nitrogen pollution
- **Yellow areas**: Medium nitrogen pollution  
- **Light areas**: Low nitrogen pollution
- **Click on areas** to see detailed numbers

#### 2. Data Tables
- **Ward totals**: Nitrogen load by administrative area
- **Population breakdown**: People by toilet type
- **Scenario comparisons**: Side-by-side results

#### 3. Downloadable Files
- **CSV files**: Raw data for further analysis
- **GeoJSON files**: Geographic data for GIS software
- **PNG maps**: Static images for reports

### Key Numbers to Look For

- **kg/year**: Total nitrogen load per area per year
- **kg/person/year**: Nitrogen load per person (for comparing areas of different sizes)
- **Hotspots**: Areas with highest total loads (priority for interventions)

## üéõÔ∏è Scenarios You Can Test

### 1. Baseline 2022
- Current population and sanitation conditions
- Uses actual census data

### 2. Improved Removal
- Same population, but with 80% nitrogen removal efficiency
- Shows impact of upgrading sanitation systems

### 3. Population Growth  
- Test different population growth scenarios
- Plan for future infrastructure needs

### 4. Custom Efficiency
- Experiment with different removal efficiencies by toilet type
- Model specific technology improvements

## üí° Tips for Decision Makers

### Quick Impact Assessment
1. **Start with Pathogen Tab** - shows immediate health risks
2. **Identify hot-spot wards** - focus resources where most needed
3. **Test intervention scenarios** - see which changes have biggest impact
4. **Export priority ward lists** - for action planning

### Interpreting Health Risks
- **Open defecation contamination** = immediate disease risk
- **High pathogen load wards** = priority for emergency intervention  
- **Intervention impact %** = expected health improvement

## üîß Advanced Features

### Scenario Parameters
- **Population Growth Factor**: Adjust future population projections
- **Nitrogen Removal Efficiency**: Model technology improvements
- **Preset Scenarios**: Quick access to common modeling scenarios

### Data Export
- Download results as CSV files for further analysis
- Export maps for presentations and reports
- Share findings with stakeholders

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dashboard Loading Slowly
- **Cause**: Large dataset processing
- **Solution**: Wait for data caching to complete (first load only)

#### Map Not Displaying
- **Cause**: Browser compatibility or internet connection
- **Solution**: Try refreshing page or different browser

#### Scenario Results Look Wrong
- **Cause**: Extreme parameter values
- **Solution**: Reset to default values and adjust gradually

## üìû Support

- Contact your dashboard administrator
- Refer to the Model Implementation Report for technical details

Q: **Is my analysis data secure?**
A: The dashboard uses default Zanzibar data and all analysis runs locally in your browser session.
