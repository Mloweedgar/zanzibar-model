# Model vs. Scenarios: Feasibility Review

**Date:** October 2025
**Subject:** Feasibility of Simulating BEST-Z Sanitation Scenarios with Current FIO Model

## Executive Summary
The current FIO Model is **highly capable** of supporting **Scenario 1** (Targeted Protection) and **Scenario 2** (CWIS/Upgrades). It was designed precisely for this: linking sanitation changes to groundwater risk.

For **Scenario 3** (Marine/Stone Town), the model has limitations. It models *groundwater* quality, not *marine* dispersion. However, it can still be used to calculate the **"Load Reduction"** (how much pollution is removed from the island), which is a strong proxy for marine protection.

## Scenario 1: Targeted Borehole Protection & FSM
*Objective: Rapid risk reduction for top 5% riskiest private boreholes.*

| Component | Model Capability | Verdict | How to Simulate (No Code Changes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identify Top 5% Risk** | **High** | ✅ Ready | Use the new `risk_score` column. Filter for `risk_score > 95` (or top 5% count). |
| **Borehole Protection Zones (35m)** | **High** | ✅ Ready | Create a Scenario in `config.py` that identifies these boreholes and changes all `toilet_category_id` within 35m to "Septic" (3) or "Sewer" (1). |
| **CLTS (Stop Open Defecation)** | **High** | ✅ Ready | Create a Scenario that changes all `toilet_category_id == 4` (OD) to `2` (Pit) or `3` (Septic). |
| **FSM Plant Rehab (Kibele/Kizimbani)** | **None** | ❌ Out of Scope | The model does not simulate treatment plant efficiency or sludge transport. |

**Strategy:** Run a "Scenario 1" where you upgrade sanitation *only* around the high-risk points identified in the Baseline run.

## Scenario 2: CWIS Expansion
*Objective: District-wide upgrades (Pit -> Septic) and decentralized treatment.*

| Component | Model Capability | Verdict | How to Simulate (No Code Changes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pit -> Septic Upgrades** | **High** | ✅ Ready | This is the model's core strength. Create a Scenario that changes `toilet_category_id` from `2` (Pit) to `3` (Septic) for X% of households or specific Wards. |
| **Decentralized Treatment (FSTP)** | **Partial** | ⚠️ Proxy | You cannot model the plant itself. However, you can model the *result*: if FSTPs mean "better containment", you can increase the `containment_efficiency` parameter for Septic tanks in `config.py`. |
| **Regulated Emptying** | **Partial** | ⚠️ Proxy | Similar to above. If emptying prevents overflow, simulate this by improving the `containment_efficiency` of Septic Tanks (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.8). |

**Strategy:** Run a "Scenario 2" where you globally (or regionally) upgrade Pits to Septics and boost their efficiency to represent better management.

## Scenario 3: Stone Town Centralized WWTP
*Objective: Eliminate marine outfalls and sewer Stone Town.*

| Component | Model Capability | Verdict | How to Simulate (No Code Changes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sewering Stone Town** | **High** | ✅ Ready | Identify Stone Town wards. Change all `toilet_category_id` in those wards to `1` (Sewer). |
| **Marine Outfall Impact** | **Low** | ❌ Limitation | The model calculates *Groundwater* concentration, not *Marine* concentration. It cannot show "Cleaner Ocean". |
| **Load Reduction** | **High** | ✅ Proxy | You *can* calculate the massive reduction in **Nitrogen/Pathogen Load** generated by Stone Town. Even if you can't show the ocean plume, you can show: *"We removed 500 tons of pollution that was going into the sea."* |

**Strategy:** Run a "Scenario 3" that converts Stone Town to 100% Sewer. Report the **Total Load Reduction** (in kg/day) rather than borehole risk (since Stone Town uses piped water anyway).

## Summary of "Can vs Cannot"

| Feature | Can Model? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Groundwater Risk** | ✅ **YES** | Core feature. Perfect for Scenarios 1 & 2. |
| **Sanitation Upgrades** | ✅ **YES** | Easy to change Pits -> Septics -> Sewers. |
| **Spatial Targeting** | ✅ **YES** | Can target specific Wards or Radii. |
| **Marine Water Quality** | ❌ **NO** | **Critical Gap.** Use "Total Load Reduction" as a proxy. |
| **Treatment Plant Tech** | ❌ **NO** | Cannot simulate "drying beds" or "screens". |
| **Sludge Logistics** | ❌ **NO** | Cannot simulate trucks or routes. |

## Recommendation
Proceed with simulating **all three scenarios**, but frame the results carefully:
*   **Scenario 1 & 2**: Report "Reduction in Groundwater Risk" (Risk Score).
*   **Scenario 3**: Report "Reduction in Total Pollution Load" (Tonnes/Year).
